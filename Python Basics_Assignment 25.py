# ### 1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?
#     List Comprehension with square brackets produces list.
#     List Comprehension with parentheses creates generators
#     
# 

# In[1]:


lstSquare = [i for i in range(10)]
lstSquare


# If you are familiar with list comprehensions, then this look likes it might create a tuple which is (1,2,3,4,....), but it is actually a generator expression - this expression is a one time only iterator which will yield the values 1, 2, 3, 4.... in that order

# In[2]:


lstParanthesis = (i for i in range(10))
lstParanthesis


# In[3]:


list(lstParanthesis)


# ### 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?
#     An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples etc
#     Using an iterator-
#     iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.
#     next() keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.
#     
#     Generator
#     It is another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword “yield” instead of returning it in a defined function
#     Generators are implemented using a function
#     Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. 
#     It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory
#     By using next() function we can iterate the output of generator function

# In[13]:


# iterator
iter_list = iter(['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana'])
print(next(iter_list))
print(next(iter_list))
print(next(iter_list))


# In[24]:


# GEnerator 

def sq_numbers(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        yield i*i


# In[25]:


sq_numbers(8)


# In[26]:


lst = sq_numbers(8)


# In[27]:


lst


# In[28]:


print(next(lst))
print(next(lst))
print(next(lst))
print(next(lst))


# ### 3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?
#     If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.
# 
#    
# 

# ### 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?
#     A yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and 
#     returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator 
#     function

# ### 5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.
#     Map function:
#     Suppose we have a function and we want to compute this function for different values in a single line of code . This is where map() function plays its role. map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)
#     
#     If we already have a function defined, it is often good to use map For example, map(sum, myLists) is more neat than [sum(x) for x in myLists]. You gain the elegance of not having to make up a dummy variable (e.g. sum(x) for x... or sum(_) for _... or sum(readableName) for readableName...) which you have to type twice, just to iterate.
#     
#     List Comprehension:
#     List Comprehension is a substitute for the lambda function, map(), filter() and reduce()
#     
#     
#     Comparision :
#         1. List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map
#         2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility
#         For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is 
#         no alternate for it in map
#         3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required, where as map only returns a map object and does 
#         not return any list.
#         4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated 
#         to express
#         5. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)
